# About A11yhood.org


[a11yhood.org](https://a11yhood.org)  is a central hub for information about open-source assistive technologies. It serves as a tool for disabled makers, developers, and contributors and their allies and communities to find, use, and contribute to a variety of open-source accessibility projects. 

## Mission

Please join us, make use of what  and help us to create new solutions, answer questions about existing ones, and expand what [a11yhood.org](https://a11yhood.org) has to offer. 

## Where does our data come from?

We are continually expanding the list of domains from which we allow contributions. As domains are added, we develop scrapers that can also autopopulate [a11yhood.org](https://a11yhood.org) with new products. The current list of supported domains includes:

- [GitHub](github.com): GitHub is where people build software, though a range of other types of products can be found here. We currently scrape products with tags like "speech recognition" "switch access" "screen reader" "braille" and so on.
- [Ravelry](ravelry.com): Raverly is an inclusive, friendly website for knitters, crocheters, spinners, weavers, and dyers. Members share patterns, advice, and more.  We scrape everything labeled as accessibility in the Ravelry [advanced pattern search](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/search).
- [Thingiverse](thingiverse.com): Thingiverse is a design community for discovering, making, and sharing 3D printable things. We currently scrape products with tags like "disability" "adaptive utensil" "braille" and so on.
- [AbleData](https://www.mobilitywithlove.com/what-happened-to-abledata/): AbleData.com was a website sponsored by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research. Before it ended, it contained information on over 40,000 assistive technology products and rehabilitation-related equipment. Much of that information is still on the [internet archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20170110175202/http://www.abledata.com/), and we are working on scraping it. 

## Features 

We aim to provide features such as:
- Centralized repository of software, tutorials, commentary, and reviews.
- Accessible development support for disabled contributors.
- Community-driven skill sharing and discussion.
- Open source and accessible code base and documentation
