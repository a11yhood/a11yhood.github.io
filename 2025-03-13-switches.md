# Cataloging Accessible Switches with HuskyAdapt Switch System Team

Finding the right accessible switch can be overwhelming and expensive, and some don’t even know these devices exist. As part of HuskyADAPT, our Switch System team set out to increase awareness and accessibility by creating a free, user-friendly website that helps people navigate the world of adaptive switches. Whether someone is looking for information on where to buy switches, affordable alternatives, or guidance on making their own DIY switch, our website provides a centralized resource to support a variety of needs.

Our process involved researching, testing, and evaluating different DIY switch designs to ensure they are affordable, durable, and easy to build. Some designs require 3D printing and soldering, while others can be made with simple household materials. By including a range of options, we hope to help individuals with different mobility needs and skill levels find the best switch solution for them. Please check out our research at a11yhood/accessible-switches, and consider contributing on Github.

This project has been an exciting opportunity to apply engineering, design, and accessibility research in a way that directly impacts real people. As we continue to expand our website and refine our resources, we look forward to gathering more feedback and improving accessibility for even more users. Through HuskyADAPT, we’ve seen firsthand how collaboration across disciplines can drive innovative solutions, and we are excited to keep growing this project to make adaptive technology more accessible for all.
